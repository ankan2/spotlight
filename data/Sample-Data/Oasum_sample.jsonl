The concept of the show is that one or two main event matches are contested inside the Elimination Chamber, either with championships or future opportunities at championships at stake. The 2012 event was the third event under the Elimination Chamber chronology and the first to be held since the end of the first brand split in August 2011. The event was scheduled to be held on February 19, 2012, at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.The previous year, the show was promoted as \"No Escape\" in Germany as it was feared that the name \"Elimination Chamber\" may remind people of the gas chambers used during the Holocaust. For the 2012 event, the show was promoted as \"No Way Out.\" Elimination Chamber featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that we are played out on \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"WWE Superstars\"WWE's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first match was announced by Interim Raw General Manager John Laurinaitis on January 30, 2012, on WWE's website. The announcement stated that there would be an Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship. In the match, CM Punk would defend his championship against Dolph Ziggler, Chris Jericho, The Miz, R-Truth, and Kofi Kingston. The following week on \"Raw\", Jericho won a Six-Pack Challenge featuring all six Elimination Chamber participants to earn the right to enter the match last. On February 3, 2012, it was announced that there would also be an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship. In the match, Daniel Bryan would defend his championship against Cody Rhodes, Wade Barrett, Big Show, The Great Khali, and Santino Marella. Originally, Mark Henry was named as a participant in the match, but was removed from the contest and suspended indefinitely by SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long for threatening him. Khali replaced him in the match. Randy Orton was also originally a participant in the match, but suffered a concussion after Bryan hit him over the head with the title belt on the February 13, 2012 episode of \"Raw\". His replacement would be Marella, who won a battle royal on the February 17, 2012 episode of \"SmackDown\". John Cena and Kane began feuding in December 2011, with Kane targeting Cena due to his T-shirt slogan, \"Rise Above Hate\". To play psychological games with Cena, Kane began targeting Cena's friend Zack Ryder and his on-screen girlfriend, Eve Torres, attacking Ryder and cornering Eve in a variety of situations, all in an effort to make Cena \"embrace the hate.\" On the February 6 episode of \"Raw\", an Ambulance match was announced for Elimination Chamber between Kane and Cena. Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Hunico defeated Alex Riley in a dark match. The first match to air on pay-per-view was the Elimination Chamber match between reigning champion CM Punk, Dolph Ziggler, Chris Jericho, Kofi Kingston, R-Truth and The Miz for the WWE Championship. Punk started off the match with Kingston. Punk sent Kingston into a pod and performed a Suplex on Kingston onto the chamber floor. Ziggler entered at #3, targeting Punk. R-Truth entered at #4, being eliminated by Punk after a diving elbow drop. Next was Miz followed by Jericho, who won the right to enter last after winning a Six-Pack Challenge on \"Raw\". Jericho eliminated Ziggler after a Codebreaker and eliminated Kingston after forcing Kingston to submit to the Liontamer. Jericho was then knocked out after a roundhouse kick by Punk, leading to him falling out of the chamber (which had been opened to let Kingston out after he was eliminated) and accidentally landed on a camera man, thus being deemed unable to continue by the ringside trainers. Punk and Miz we are the final two, after Punk kicked out of the Skull Crushing Finale, Punk performed a G.T.S. on Miz to score the final fall and retain his championship. Next was the Divas Championship match between reigning champion Beth Phoenix and Tamina Snuka. After a back-and forth-contest, Snuka would performed a Samoan drop to set up the Superfly Splash. Phoenix countered by superplexing Snuka from the top rope. Snuka then scored a superkick-Superfly Splash combination to Phoenix, leading to a close near-fall. Phoenix performed a Glam Slam on Snuka to score the pinfall and retain her title. Next was the Elimination Chamber match between reigning champion Daniel Bryan, Big Show, The Great Khali, Cody Rhodes, Wade Barrett and Santino Marella for the World Heavyweight Championship. Barrett and Big Show we are the first two in the ring, attacking one another. Rhodes entered at #3, who worked with Barrett for much of the match, attempting to slow down Big Show. Marella entered at #4, who immediately got attacked by Big Show. Khali entered at #5 and managed to dominate for a while but soon got speared by Show straight away and pinned. Show climbed Bryan's pod, ripping off the chains and attacking him. When Bryan got out, Rhodes and Barrett immediately attacked Show. After a DDT by Rhodes and a driving elbow drop from Barrett, Rhodes pinned and eliminated Big Show. Rhodes was eliminated by Marella after a roll-up. Barrett was eliminated by Marella, following a diving headbutt by Bryan. The final two we are Bryan and Marella, who scored a close near-fall after performing The Cobra. Marella was shocked that Bryan had kicked out and while he was in shock, Bryan forced Marella to submit to the LeBell Lock, retaining his championship. After the match, Sheamus ran in and attacked Bryan in retaliation for Bryan spitting on him on the previous episode of \"SmackDown\". This indicated that Sheamus had selected to challenge Bryan for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII, which Sheamus won the right to do after his victory in the Royal Rumble match. Next was an impromptu United States Championship match between Justin Gabriel (with Hornswoggle) and champion Jack Swagger (with Vickie Guerrero). Gabriel gave Swagger an intense challenge but Swagger eventually applied the Ankle lock and made Gabriel submit to retain the championship. The main event was the Ambulance match between John Cena and Kane. They fought out of the ring for most of the match where Cena attacked Kane repeatedly with the steel ring steps. As he attempted to give Kane an Attitude Adjustment off the ring steps through the announce table, Kane countered and chokeslammed Cena through the table instead. With Cena down, Kane placed him onto a gurney and loaded him into the ambulance. Before Kane could shut the door, though, Cena fought his way out of the ambulance and took the fight to the top of the vehicle, where he finally finished off Kane with an Attitude Adjustment off the ambulance onto the equipment area. Cena then loaded Kane into the ambulance to score the victory. The Canadian Online Explorer gave the event a mixed review with an overall rating of 5 out of 10. The Elimination Chamber matches we are particularly praised, with the WWE Championship match given an 8 out of 10 rating and the World Heavyweight Championship match a 9 out of 10. In contrast, the United States Championship match was criticized as it \"seemed to be shoehorned into the card\" and was given a 2 out of 10.

His father was Louis-Joseph-Napolon Lepic (18101875), who had a distinguished military career and was a close supporter of Napolon III. Destined for a similar career, Ludovic persuaded his father to allow him to train as a painter instead, originally with Gustave Wappers, the official painter of the Belgian king, and later with the animal painter Charles Verlat, who encouraged him to take up etching. Much of Lepic's early work was in this genre, and he joined the \"Socit des aquafortistes\" in 1862. The following year, he gained notability for his sentimental etching \"For the poor\", after which he undertook further training from Charles Gleyre and the academic artist Alexandre Cabanel. During the next few years, he took up archaeology and between 186976 was a member of the \"Socit d'anthropologie de Paris\". In 1872, he founded a museum at Aix-les-Bains and published a ground-breaking illustrated work on prehistoric tools, \"Les armes et les outils prhistoriques reconstitus\". His experiments with etching during this time we are equally innovative, and he developed the technique of 'variable etching' (\"eau-forte mobile\") where, by varying the ink on the plate, he was able to produce individual results at each printing. He was to teach this technique to his old friend Edgar Degas and the two co-operated on, and duly signed, Degas' large monotype \"The ballet master\" of 1874, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Lepic and Degas we are friends as young men, with similar interests, and we are to co-operate in other ways too. It was Degas who persuaded Lepic to help plan and participate in the first two Impressionist exhibitions, but insistence by the group that he should not exhibit at the same time in the official Salon led Lepic to distance himself from them. During this time, he had bought himself a boat and from 1877 paid annual visits to the town of Berck, south of Le Touquet, which was an artistic haven also for other artists on the fringes of Impressionism, such as douard Manet and Eugne Boudin. It is for his depictions of the beach and fishing boats there that Lepic is particularly remembered as a painter today. In 1883, he achieved recognition by being appointed an official marine painter by the state, following his growing popularity after the award of a medal at the 1877 Salon. In 1879, he had a large individual exhibition of some 100 pictures at the Gallery \"La vie moderne\" and in 1883, he exhibited 150 at the Muse des Arts dcoratifs. In between, he had published an illustrated account of an archaeological trip to Egypt, \"La dernire Egypte\" (1881). The appearance of Lepic in several works by Degas records some of the enthusiasms they had in common. These included horse racing and Degas' \"Gentlemen's race: Before the start\" (1862; Muse d'Orsay) pictures Lepic mounted among the jockeys. Ballet was another enthusiasm. Lepic is shown gazing through opera glasses in \"The ballet from Robert le Diable\" (1871; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), one of Degas' earliest treatments of the subject, and in quarter profile from behind in the Victoria & Albert Museum's larger copy (1876). Lepic's fondness for dogs, evidenced by his many etchings, resulted in Degas' final pastel of Lepic holding one in the Cleveland Museum of Art (1889). Earlier, he had included another dog in the amusing \"Place de la Concorde\", in which the elegantly dressed and cigar-smoking Lepic strides to the right, an umbrella under his arm, while his two daughters and the dog all face the other way. Earlier still, the daughters appeared on either side of their father in the intimate painting \"Ludovic Lepic and His Daughters\" (1871). Notwithstanding his marriage in 1865 with Josphine Scvole de Barral, the mother of these daughters, Lepic was later to take the prima ballerina Marie Sanlaville as his mistress and designed dresses for the ballets in which she danced, including the Harlequin costume for \"Les Jumeaux de Bergame\". Degas was also to sketch this while it was in rehearsal in 1885. In 1889, he was suddenly taken ill, and Marie Sanlaville cared for him at her apartment until his death in October.
