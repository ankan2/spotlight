General Assemblythat Russia\u2019s \u201cnaked aggression\u201d in Ukraine is an affront to the heart of what the international body stands for as he looks to rally allies to stand firm in backing the Ukrainian resistance.Biden, during his time at the U.N. General Assembly, also planned to meet Wednesday with new BritishPrime Minister Liz Truss,announce a global food security initiative and press allies to meet an $18 billion target to replenish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.But White House officials say the crux of the president\u2019s visit to the U.N. this year would be a full-throated condemnation of Russia as its brutalwar nears the seven-month mark.\u201cHe\u2019ll offer a firm rebuke of Russia\u2019s unjust war in Ukraine and make a call to the world to continue to stand against the naked aggression that we\u2019ve seen these past several months,\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in previewing the president\u2019s address. \u201cHe will underscore the importance of strengthening the United Nations and reaffirm core tenets of its charter at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council has struck at the very heart of the charter by challenging the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\u201dThe address comes as Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plansto hold Kremllin-backed referendumsin days ahead on becoming part of Russia and as Moscow is losing ground in the invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesdayannounced a partial mobilizationto call up 300,000 reservists and accused the West of engaging in \u201cnuclear blackmail.\u201dBiden is confronting no shortage of difficult issues as leaders gather this year.In addition to the Russian war in Ukraine,Europeanfears that a recessioncould be just around the corner are heightened. Administration concerns grow by the day that time is running short to revive theIran nuclear dealand over China\u2019s saber-rattling on Taiwan.When he addressed last year\u2019s General Assembly,Biden focused on broad themes of global partnership, urging world leaders to act with haste against the coronavirus, climate change and human rights abuses. And he offered assurances that his presidency marked a return of American leadership to international institutions following Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.But one year later, global dynamics have dramatically changed.Stewart Patrick, senior fellow and director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in ananalysisthat Biden\u2019s task this year is \u201cimmense\u201d compared to his first address to the U.N. as president.\u201cLast year, the U.S. leader won easy plaudits as the \u2018anti-Trump,\u2019 pledging that \u2018America was back,\u2019\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThis year demands more. The liberal, rules-based international system is reeling, battered by Russian aggression, Chinese ambitions, authoritarian assaults, a halting pandemic recovery, quickening climate change, skepticism of the U.N.\u2019s relevance, and gnawing doubts about American staying power.\u201dBeyond diplomacy, the president is also doing some politicking. This year\u2019s gathering comes less than seven weeks beforepivotal midterm electionsin the United States. Shortly after arriving in Manhattan on Tuesday night, Biden spoke at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser for about 100 participants that raised nearly $2 million, and he\u2019s set to hold another fundraiser on Thursday before heading back to Washington.His Wednesday address comes on the heels of Ukrainian forcesretaking control of large stretches of territorynear Kharkiv. But even as Ukrainian forces have racked up battlefield wins, much of Europe is feeling painful blowback from economic sanctions levied against Russia. A vast reduction in Russian oil and gas has led to a sharp jump in energy prices, skyrocketing inflation and growing risk of Europe slipping into a recession.Biden\u2019s visit to the U.N. also comes as his administration\u2019s efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal appears stalled.The deal brokered by the Obama administration \u2014 and scrapped by Trump in 2018 \u2014 provided billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for Iran\u2019s agreement to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to extensive international inspection.Sullivan said no breakthrough with Iran is expected during the General Assembly but Biden would make clear in his speech that a deal can still be done \u201cif Iran is prepared to be serious about its obligations.\u201d He added that administration officials would be consulting with fellow signatories of the 2015 deal on the sidelines of this week\u2019s meetings.This year\u2019s U.N. gathering is back to being a full-scale, in-person event after two years of curtailed activity due to the pandemic. In 2020, the in-person gathering was canceled and leaders instead delivered prerecorded speeches; last year was a mix of in-person and prerecorded speeches. Biden and first lady Jill Biden were set to host a leaders\u2019 reception on Wednesday evening.China\u2019s President Xi Jinping opted not to attend this year\u2019s U.N. gathering, but his country\u2019s conduct and intentions will loom large during the leaders\u2019 talks.Last month, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about possible\u201ccrimes against humanity\u201din China\u2019s western region against Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups. Beijing has vowed to suspend cooperation with the office and blasted what it described as a Western plot to undermine China\u2019s rise.Meanwhile, China\u2019s government on Monday said Biden\u2019s statement in a CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that American forceswould defend Taiwanif Beijing tried to invade the self-ruled island was a violation of U.S. commitments on the matter, but it gave no indication of possible retaliation.The White House said after the interview that there has been no change in U.S. policy on Taiwan, which China claims as its own. That policy says Washington wants to see Taiwan\u2019s status resolved peacefully but doesn\u2019t say whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.___Follow AP coverage of the U.N.

Police also declined to comment on a report that a police officer was caught in the fire.The incident underscores a growing wave of protests against the funeral for Abe, who was one of the most divisive leaders in postwar Japanese politics because of his revisionist view of wartime history, support for a stronger military, and what critics call an autocratic approach and cronyism. More protests are expected in coming days, including the day of the funeral next week.It also is an embarrassment for police, who have stepped up security for an event expected to be attended by about 6,000 people, including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and other dignitaries.Policewere also partly blamed for insufficient protection of Abe, who was shot to death by a gunman who approached him from behind as he was giving an outdoor campaign speech in July.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders. He gave a speech Tuesday expressing disappointment over the Security Council\u2019s failure to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine because of Russia\u2019s permanent veto and called for reforms that would allow the U.N. to better defend global peace and order.The planned state funeral for Abe has become increasingly unpopular among Japanese as more details emerge about the governing Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s and Abe\u2019s links to the Unification Church, which built close ties with party lawmakers over their shared interests in conservative causes.The suspect in Abe\u2019s assassination reportedly believed his mother\u2019s large donations to the church ruined his family.The LDPhas said nearly half its lawmakers have ties to the church, but party officials have denied ties between the party as an organization and the church.Kishida has said Abe deserves the honor of a state funeral as Japan\u2019s longest-serving post-World War II leader and for his diplomatic and economic achievements.Critics have said it was decided undemocratically and is an inappropriate and costly use of taxpayers\u2019 money. They say Kishida decided to hold a state funeral to please Abe\u2019s party faction and buttress his own power. Support ratings for Kishida\u2019s government have weakened amid public dissatisfaction over his handling of the party\u2019s church ties and the funeral plans.A family funeral for Abe was held at a Buddhist temple in July. The state funeral is scheduled for next Tuesday at the Budokan martial arts arena in Tokyo.", "summary": "A man set himself on fire near the Japanese prime minister's office in Tokyo in protest against the state funeral for former leader Shinzo Abe. The man, believed to be in his 70s, survived the incident. The act highlights growing opposition to the funeral due to Abe's controversial politics and alleged links to the Unification Church.

It follows the reboot of a fictional early 2000s family sitcom, \u201cStep Right Up,\u201d and the tensions it places on its dysfunctional cast and crew.Among the stars of the show (and show within a show) are Keegan-Michael Key, Judy Greer and Johnny Knoxville, whose characters begrudgingly sign on for the reboot after many disappointing career and life changes since the original run. Paul Reiser \u2014 who was recently in a reboot of his own, with the 2019 revival of 1990s sitcom \u201cMad About You\u201d \u2014 and Rachel Bloom play Gordon and Hannah, the father-daughter team of showrunners behind the relaunch of \u201cStep Right Up.\u201dPremiering Tuesday, the eight-episode series marks creator Steven Levitan\u2019s first show since thelong-running ABC sitcom \u201cModern Family.\u201dHuffPost Senior Culture Reporters Marina Fang and Candice Frederick discuss what they thought of \u201cReboot\u201d and assess where it fits into the larger cultural conversation on the topic.Marina Fang:All of us on the HuffPost culture desk talk a lot about the seemingly never-ending stream of reboots, revivals, re-imaginings, etc., etc. \u2014 what I often like to joke is the \u201creboot industrial complex.\u201d So the idea of a sitcom about a fictional reboot of a sitcom, involving a lot of people who\u2019ve been part of major sitcoms before, definitely piqued my interest. Candice, what did you think of \u201cReboot,\u201d and how well do you think it captures this cultural moment we\u2019re in?Candice Frederick:Yeah, the reboot industrial complex is real, and it\u2019s exhausting. So, I went into \u201cReboot\u201d fearing it would be a bit navel-gazey and unnecessary.But I was struck by how much it delves into what it means to actually go forward with a reboot, the human impact of it. Like, how the actors, who haven\u2019t worked in forever \u2014 or who haven\u2019t gotten the type of prestige work they thought would follow after the series \u2014 are ill-equipped to deal with the new celebrity industrial complex where media can be very vampiric with their personal questions, or what it means to bring a show from a certain period into present day.What\u2019s to become of the original staff writers? Can they write dialogue that pertains or contends with today\u2019s culture? What does that look like when they have to share a writing room with younger writers? The generational questions were interesting to me.What did you think going into it?Initial ThoughtsMF:Absolutely, I had those exact same fears. But I think it finds the right balance in its meta jokes about the industry. For example, the show within a show, like the show itself, is being produced at Hulu, and one of the characters is a fictionalized Hulu executive. That was all very funny.Once I started watching it, I found myself wishing it had a sharper point of view about the concept of reboots \u2014 a specific thing it was trying to say about it all. But then, when you and I were deciding to do this \u201cShould You Watch It?\u201d article, you mentioned everything you said above. And I realized you\u2019re totally right, that this is what really makes this show interesting.In the larger cultural discussion around reboots, we don\u2019t talk as much about what it means for the actors and writers to return to something they made 20 years ago, that probably hasn\u2019t aged well, and how they\u2019re probably in a very different place in their lives and careers when they decide to do these reboots. This show does a great job of exploring those dynamics.Standout PerformancesMF:The dynamic between Bree and Reed (Greer and Key) felt totally lived-in. Like, I totally bought that they had a thing 20 years ago, and being together again is bringing up all kinds of messy feelings. I loved both of those performances, part of a really stacked cast on this show.Candice, what did you think of the cast, and were there any really standout performances for you?CF:OMG yes! Loved that the comedy exec at Hulu (Krista Marie Yu) is hyperserious and actually knows nothing about comedy. I\u2019m sure this happens a lot in the industry.To your point, though, it did stick out to me that the show doesn\u2019t have a point of view about reboots \u2014 especially since you and I both definitely do! But I also wonder if these folks who decide to do a reboot actually have a point of view on that. Some need the money. Others need their careers reinvigorated. Others, especially women like Judy Greer\u2019s character, need to prove that they still have it and that the industry can\u2019t send them out to pasture just yet. That was all very interesting to me.LOL, Judy and Keegan are comedy gold, totally agree. You know who I also thought was quite interesting? Alyah Chanelle Scott, who plays Timberly, who\u2019s kind of a plant from the reality TV show industrial complex. She parlayed that into a scripted TV career. But when she tries to prove herself, of course people like Bree feel threatened. That was a totally unexpected storyline that actually made a lot of sense to me, and I think both women are very good there.What did you think of Johnny Knoxville and his character (who I admit I have never actually seen on anything before)? I intentionally avoided the whole \u201cJackass\u201d phenomenon.MF:Yes, I liked how that all felt very real!I also have never watched any of the installments of the \u201cJackass\u201d franchise. I did like that his character seemed pretty reflective of a washed-up, middle-aged white dude \u2014 like, you can easily picture a real-life equivalent.CF:Same! He is definitely a major source of comic relief but actually has gravitas. Like a whole lot of these characters, he\u2019s been sort of just ... floating since this TV show. So, we get to see him really wrangle with that as well.So, there\u2019s a whole other section of the show that could have possibly been its own series, which is the relationship between Rachel Bloom\u2019s and Paul Reiser\u2019s characters, Hannah and Gordon. As a stand-alone character, I think Gordon is actually more interesting as the returning showrunner who\u2019s trying to navigate the new turf and having to partner with his daughter, Hannah. Hannah is the more unsure character, who\u2019s still getting her feet wet. But we again see how these two generations can work together.MF:Yeah, I liked seeing the writers room, which is another place where the show could have gotten a bit too navel-gazey, but it really works. Gordon is used to doing things the old way: hiring all of his friends, writing a bunch of hacky, tired jokes, etc. Meanwhile, Hannah is trying to make a more substantive show and hire a more inclusive writers room. The way they are constantly at an impasse feels like a lot of what we see play out in real life.Were there any other high points for you, or anything else you wanted to shout out? I think it\u2019s safe to say we both liked it.CF:Yes! The genuineness of their reactions really worked. Like, that is exactly how I would imagine it would be.Should \u201cReboot\u201d Get Another Season?CF:I think one question that came to mind is whether this deserves another season. Like, do we want more of this story? Honestly, I\u2019d watch. I think there is more story to mine here.MF:That\u2019s a good question! Like a lot of streaming series, these eight episodes tell a complete story but also leave just enough of an opening for another season. I could go either way. If they do pick it up for a second season, I\u2019d watch it.CF:Same! I\u2019d like to know more about these people. Somewhat related: Did you ever watch the show \u201cUnreal\u201d? I think this would make a good companion piece because of what they both say about the human impact of putting on what are ultimately scripted TV shows.MF:Yes, I did watch and really liked \u201cUnreal,\u201d until it went off the rails in its later seasons. There was alsoa short-lived Fox show last yearcalled \u201cThe Big Leap,\u201d which is similar to \u201cUnreal\u201d but the show within a show is a dance competition series \u2014 another possibility, if you\u2019re reading this and want to check out more of these shows with meta qualities about TV. Can we call them \u201cRussian doll shows\u201d? LOL.CF:Haha I love that \u2014 and now I have to find \u201cThe Big Leap\u201d! Never even heard of it.So, Should You Watch It?MF:Anyway, should you watch \u201cReboot\u201d? Definitely.CF:And yes, I really like \u201cReboot\u201d! Would recommend.", "summary": "Hulu's new comedy series \"Reboot\" explores the cultural phenomenon of TV show reboots.

For others, it\u2019s the fear that Ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. Or that the world may forget the country\u2019s plight altogether.Ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country that\u2019s fought Russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington forthe region\u2019s biggestannual Ukrainian cultural festival.Amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka \u2014 white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front \u2014 and accompanied by traditional and pop Ukrainian music, the war was never far from people\u2019s minds. What in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning.\u201cThis year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,\u201d said the church pastor, the Rev. Volodymr Steliac, as he formally opened the festival Saturday.\u201cWe have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.\u201dThe festival opened on Day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for Ukraine: asurprise counteroffensive in the northeastthat in a few days cleared Russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war.But the victory came with a price. In the strategic town of Izium,mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital Kyiv\u2019s suburb of Bucha when the war began.Oksana Sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on Europe.In the past, she said, some people suspected Ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the Russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to Russia.\u201cThen you see Bucha, you see now Izyum. And we have yet to see Kherson and Mariupol and other places,\u201d Sukhina said.Sukhina, 50, immigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv in 2020. Warned by former colleagues in the State Department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in Washington only days before the war.But as the prospect of Kyiv\u2019s being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. They joined a 23-year-old son who left his IT job in Chicago in March to help deliver food and medical supplies in Kyiv.Sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014.\u201cI\u2019m proud of them. They are trying to do whatever they can. And this is what makes us win,\u201d she said.Steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. He was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to Ukraine.In one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in Ukraine.\u201cThe war is not there alone; the war is here as well,\u201d Steliac said.Even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful.\u201cWhat was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, \u2018Oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over\u2019 and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesn\u2019t go through,\u201d Steliac said.\u201cYou think of the worst.\u201dAlex Naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from Ternopil in the western part of Ukraine, said he\u2019s had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored.Ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. Ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned.\u201cI\u2019m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents\u2019 place,\u201d Naumovych said.Naumovych arrived in the U.S. almost 11 years ago. He had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million.\u201cI love this country. Like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,\u201d he said.One of his big worries for Ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%.\u201cThe economy is in bad shape,\u201d Naumovych said. \u201cA lot of people left Ukraine and I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re coming back\u201dThe parents of software engineer Serhiy Vorobiov, 43, are near the war\u2019s front line in Zaporizhzhya, a Russian-speaking region that includesEurope\u2019s largest nuclear power plant.Russia has captured the plant and Ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail.But Vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of Zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. He said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war.\u201cMaybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. I know it\u2019s not to my defense, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said.Vorobiov, his wife Oksana, 33, and their three young children, Yaromyr, Myroslava and Oksana, have lived in the U.S. since 2020. He said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any Russian influence on their upbringing.\u201cI always dreamed of it, I just didn\u2019t want to be very tough in that. But now I have all the rights and I want to use it,\u201d Vorobiov said.\u201cI want them to forget [the] Russian language. We are from [the] Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. Forget Russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] Soviet Union. I\u2019m happy they don\u2019t know what Soviet Union is.\u201dBut in her remarks to open the festivities,Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassadorto the United States, advised focusing on the present, not the past.\u201cPlease be joyful today,\u201d she counseled.She said Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russians want Ukrainians to \u201csit down and cry\u201d at the devastation.\u201cThis is what Russians want us to do. And we will not give it to them.\u201d", "summary": "The annual Ukrainian cultural festival at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington took on a deeper meaning this year due to the ongoing war with Russia.

Our family has prayed for this each day of the more than 31 months he has been a hostage. We never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us,\u201d said a statement from the sister, Charlene Cakora.In Afghanistan, Noorzai told reporters at a press conference that he had been released from an unspecified U.S. prison and handed over earlier in the day to the Taliban in Kabul, in exchange for an American prisoner held in Afghanistan whom he did not identify.Other Taliban officials claimed Noorzai was held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, but did not offer say anything to support that claim.The Taliban-appointed foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also spoke at the press conference alongside Noorzai and welcomed the exchange, saying it marked the start of a \u201cnew era\u201d in U.S.-Taliban relations.Frerichs, abducted on Jan. 31, 2020, was last seen in a video distributed earlier this year, pleading for his release so that he can be reunited with his family, according to a recording posted by The New Yorker magazine at the time.\u201cThis can be a new chapter between Afghanistan and the United States, this can open a new door for talks between both countries,\u201d Muttaqi said at the Kabul presser.\u201cThis act shows us that all problems can be solved through talks and I thank both sides\u2019 teams who worked so hard for this to happen,\u201d Muttaqi added.Frerichs, of Lombard, Illinois, was believed to be held by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, and U.S. officials across two presidential administrations had tried unsuccessfully to get him home. In the video, which marked the first time Frerichs was seen since his abduction, he says it was filmed last November.Videos of hostages are sometimes released to show proof that they are alive and to facilitate negotiations for a release, though it was not immediately clear if that was the case here. The New Yorker said it obtained the clip from an unidentified individual in Afghanistan.At the time, theFBIdeclined to comment on the video\u2019s authenticity, but a sister of Frerichs, Charlene Cakora, issued a statement thanking the Taliban for releasing the video and describing it as \u201cpublic confirmation of our family\u2019s long-held belief that he is alive after more than two years in captivity.\u201dSince their takeover of Afghanistan in August last year, the Taliban have demanded the United States release Noorzai in exchange for Frerichs amid expectations of such exchanges for U.S. citizens held in Afghanistan.However, there has been no public sign of Washington moving forward on any sort of prisoner trade or exchange.The Taliban also posted a brief video Monday on social media showing Noorzai\u2019s arrival at the Kabul airport where he was welcomed by top Taliban officials, including Muttaqi.At the press conference, Noorzai expressed thankfulness at seeing his \u201cmujahedeen brothers\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Taliban \u2014 in Kabul.\u201cI pray for more success of the Taliban,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope this exchange can lead to peace between Afghanistan and America, because an American was released and I am also free now.\u201d___Faiez reported from Islamabad.", "summary": "American contractor Mark Frerichs, held hostage in Afghanistan by the Taliban for over two years, has been released.
